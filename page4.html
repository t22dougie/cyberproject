      <h3>What Does The Future of Cyber Security Look Like?</h3>
      <p>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are at the forefront of cyber security in an attempt to make the internet a safer place for it's users. AI and machine learning are able to sift through large quantities of information and online traffic to find abnormalities and potential threats, with this information it can provide a warning to users and the platform owners of the suspicious activity. The platform owner can then take action upon such users to protect actual users from malicious attacks.</p>

      <h3>Jobs in the space</h3>
      <p>There are many different avenues for cyber security jobs, with a high demand for employees in the UK. You can specialise in a certain element of cyber security such as cloud computing or malware. Another route is to become a hacker, but not the conventional kind(black hat hacker). Organisations employ white hat hackers to attempt to hack their website to highlight their weaknesses. The white hat hacker will then report to the organisation on where it is weakest and how they gained access to their website, from this the organisation will correct any gaps in their cyber security to prevent black hat hackers from doing the same.</p>
