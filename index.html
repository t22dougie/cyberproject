      <h3>What is Cyber Security?</h3>
      <p>Cyber security is how individuals and organisations reduce the risk of cyber attack.

      <h3>Interesting Facts</h3>
      <p>Did you know: 85% of people posting puppy photos are trying to scam you (Yes they are cute but they can be dangerous). Human error accounts for 95% of all data breaches, so become cyber aware! Every 39 seconds there is a cyber attack which highlights the volume of attacks. 43% of cyber attacks target small business, primarily because they lack the cyber security to effectively defend against cyber attacks. The global average costs of a data breach is $3.9 million, this is on average meaning it could cost a lot more. You can find more interesting facts at www.dbxuk.com/statistics/cyber-security</p>
