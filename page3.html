      <h3>Man in the Middle Attacks</h3>
      <p>A man in the middle attack is when the attacker places themselves between the user and the system or between users and intercepts messages and communication, this is done to gain personal information or disrupt communication between the user and their intended recipient. This can be prevented with end-to-end encryption meaning the information the attacker would recieve is encrypted and therefore unreadable.</p>
