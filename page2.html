      <h3>Data That Needs Protecting</h3>
      <p>If you were walking down a street and a person asked you for your home address and bank details you would not give them either, this should not change online! When using the internet, make sure to be aware that there are hackers and scammers prepared to use your personal data for their own personal gain. You should never share a password with anyone you do not trust. You should look for the lock symbol in the top left of your browser when visiting a new website to see if it is deemed safe by the browser. Do not give information where it does not seem necessary as this can be a sign of malice, such as your address when it has no relevance. </p>

      <h3>Data Breaches</h3>
      <p>A data breach is an incident where information is stolen or taken for a system without the knowledge or authorisation of the system's owner. This can be problematic due to the nature of the data being stored. Data such as home addresses, phone numbers and bank details are private information that should not be able to be breached. The Data Protection Act 2018 states that everyone responsible for using personal data has to follow strict rules known as 'data protection principles. It also states that anyone using personal data must do so lawfully, fairly and transparently. This was done to further protect personal data. </p>

      <h3>Identity Theft</h3>
      <p>Identity theft is when someone can access enough information about someone's identity to commit fraudulent activities. Identity theft can take place whether the victim is alive or deceased. There are 3 main types of identity theft, they consist of financial, medical and/or online identity theft. Financial identity theft is when a fraudster gains access to your financial accounts, often resulting in them draining the victims financial accounts of any and all assets/money. Medical indentity theft is when an individual claims to be someone they are not in order to claim on insurance to avoid medical bills, this is most common in the United States due to high medical costs. Online identity theft is when someone gains access to the victims online accounts and will restrict access for them, this can be done to gain instagram pages with many followers for monetary purposes.</p>

      <h3>Other Cybercime</h3>
      <p>There are many types of cybercrime, a few more prevalent ones are cryptojacking, ransomware and business email compromise. Cryptojacking is a practice where a victim's computing resources are taken control of and used to mine cryptocurrencies, this can be lucrative for the perpetrator as they are acquiring computing resources they do not own via malicious means. Ransomware is a more widely-known problem in which hackers will encrypt your electronic device or files on it and demand payment in order to decrypt the files for use once more. Business email compromise occurs when a hacker gains access to business emails and will ask for money from employees of a business acting as a member of that business. A common theme among all cybercrime is that the user is the factor that is most vulnerable and you must take steps to protect yourself from becoming a victim.</p>
